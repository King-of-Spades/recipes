This is the sample code for the Android recipe for getting the current device location.

This recipe is deprecated but is retained to support those devices that do not have Google Play Services installed. Android applications should use the [Fused Location Provider](/guides/android/platform_features/maps_and_location/location/#Get_Location_with_Google_Location_Services_and_the_Fused_Location_Provider) that is available through Google Play Services.
